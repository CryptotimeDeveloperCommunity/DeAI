# Why Now Is a Critical Moment for DeAI
## 1. What is DeAI?
Definition
Decentralized AI (DeAI) is a deep integration of blockchain technology, distributed computing, and artificial intelligence, which reconstructs the entire process of AI training, inference, data, model, computing power, and governance  in a decentralized manner.
What problem does it aim to solve? 

### The Three Dilemmas of Centralized Artificial Intelligence: 
**Data Monopoly and Opacity**
- Tech giants such as OpenAI and Google control the training process of data and models 
- Developers are unable to verify the results of Model Training and inference
Make AI outputs traceable, verifiable, and shareable. 

**Incentive Imbalance and Sovereignty Deficit**
- User data is collected and used without restrictions
- Training data, model fine-tuning, and Agent contributors receive no benefits


**Enable contributors to share value, Computing power monopoly and high costs**
- GPU resources are controlled by a few cloud providers and large enterprises
- API pricing power lies in the hands of the platform (prices may increase or services may be suspended at any time)
- Small and medium-sized developers find it difficult to afford the training costs
Turn idle GPUs into a global AI public computing power pool.

### Features of DeAI:
- 🔓 Open Collaboration: Anyone can contribute computing power, data, and models
- 🛡️ Data Sovereignty: Users control their own data, and FL protects privacy
- 🌍 Distributed Computing: Global idle GPUs form a computing power network, reducing costs by 50-80%
- 🔍 Transparent and Verifiable: On-chain records of the training process and inference results
- 🏛️ Community Governance: Developers jointly decide on technical routes and revenue distribution
- 💰 Agent Economic Solution: Agent has an autonomous economic identity and can conduct peer-to-peer value exchange

## 2. Why choose DeAI now?
### Historical Background: The Convergence of Three Forces
 - Major premise: AI has entered the era of infrastructure
Since 2022, ChatGPT has triggered a wave of AI application enthusiasm; by 2025, AI will evolve from a "tool" to a "core system", and every application will require AI capabilities;
But at the same time, everyone has seen the pain points of centralized platforms, such as cost, censorship, and stability 

 - Macro Environment: Regulation and Geopolitics Drive Decentralization
The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has strengthened the supervision of data privacy; the Sino-US technological competition has accelerated the demand for Localization deployment; developers are seeking AI infrastructure that is not "choked"... 

 - Industry Development: Web3 Seeks Real Application Scenarios
After the DeFi and NFT booms, the blockchain industry needs new narratives, and DeAI has emerged as the most convincing implementation direction for "blockchain + AI" ，By 2025, DeAI may drive the Web3 supercycle, similar to the DeFi Summer of 2020

### Industry Signals: Dual Influx of Capital and Developers
- Investment Boom: The influx of VCs such as a16z and Polychain, focusing on distributed computing and AI infrastructure, with over $100 million in financing in the DeAI track (Bittensor, Ritual, Gensyn, etc.); according to DefiLlama data, in the first eight months of this year, cryptocurrency projects focused on artificial intelligence raised a total of $516 million. Juan Leon, a senior investment strategist at Bitwise, predicts that by 2030, this "mega trend" could add $20 trillion to global GDP.
- Developer growth : Open source development reached record levels this year, with contributions to public code repositories reaching 1.12 billion times (up 13% year-over-year); 6 of the 10 fastest-growing code repositories are AI infrastructure projects, and it is expected that by 2025, nearly 20% of popular projects among users participating in open source projects for the first time will focus on the field of artificial intelligence.

- Ecosystem Maturity : From theory to practice, multiple mainnets have been launched and are available. In 2024-2025, DeAI projects will accelerate the launch of mainnets, marking the ecosystem's transition from Proof of Concept to production-grade applications, covering computing networks and AI integration.

## 3. Who are we? Why are we doing this?
### Who are we?
We are a group of practitioners who have been deeply involved in the field for many years inthe AI developer communityandthe Web3 domain, having participated in multiple open-source Web3 projects and communities, witnessed the rapid development of centralized AI, and also experienced the narrative of the infinite imaginative space of DeAI.
What will this manual cover?

Let's complete three key journeys together:

📚 Understanding the Essence of DeAI:  We don't talk about papers. Starting from "What is decentralized AI", we explain the core concepts, technical architecture, and value proposition of DeAI in the most straightforward language, and see the essential differences between DeAI and traditional AI. 

🛠️ Build Your DeAI Scaffold:  Theory is never as real as practice. We share 5 types of projects that developers can "directly do" from the most practical perspective, and finally obtain a technical map from the developer's perspective. 

🌐 Integrate into the DeAI ecosystem: DeAI is not a solo battle. We will recommend active communities (where to find like-minded developers), projects worth following, and practical opportunities (how to contribute code, run nodes, participate in governance, job opportunities, etc.) 
The goal of this handbook is simple:  to enable you to understand DeAI within 30 minutes, get hands-on practice within a few hours, and allow more AI developers and Web3 developers to smoothly transition within a few weeks, ultimately becoming a participant in the DeAI ecosystem. 

### Three Principles
1. Small but beautiful: Not pursuing large and comprehensive, but only focusing on core concepts + runnable code
2. Down-to-earth: Enabling ordinary developers to "understand, use, and spread"
3. Sustainable : Open source collaboration, continuously updated with technological evolution 
We believe 
The future of AI should not be in the hands of a few companies . When global developers can freely access computing power, train models, and deploy applications, and when users truly own their data and AI assistants,  this is what AI should be .
 
**This handbook is the starting point, and the real power lies in you -  reading it, using it, improving it, and spreading it.**
