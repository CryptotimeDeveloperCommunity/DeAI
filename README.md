# DeAI Beginner’s Handbook
The first Chinese-speaking DeAI guidance. From code to career. 
Decentralized AI (DeAI) is a deep integration of blockchain technology, distributed computing, and artificial intelligence, which reconstructs the entire process of AI's training, inference, data, model, computing power, and governance in a decentralized manner.

# Who are we? Why are we doing this?

## Who are we?
We are a group of practitioners who have been deeply involved in the field for many years inthe AI developer communityandthe Web3 domain, having participated in multiple open-source Web3 projects and communities, witnessed the rapid development of centralized AI, and also experienced the narrative of the infinite imaginative space of DeAI.

## What will this manual cover?
Let's complete three key journeys together:

**📚 Understanding the Essence of DeAI**:  We won't delve into academic papers. Starting from "What is Decentralized AI," we will explain the core concepts, technical architecture, and value proposition of DeAI in the most straightforward language, and see the fundamental differences between DeAI and traditional AI. 

**🛠️ Build Your DeAI Scaffold**:  Theory is never as real as practice. We share 5 types of projects that developers can "directly implement" from the most practical perspective, and finally obtain a technical map from the developer's perspective. 

** 🌐 Integrate into the DeAI ecosystem**: DeAI is not a solo battle. We will recommend active communities ( where to find like-minded developers), projects worth following, and practical opportunities ( how to contribute code, run nodes, participate in governance, job opportunities, etc.) 

The goal of this manual is simple:  **to enable you to understand DeAI within 30 minutes, get hands-on experience within a few hours, and allow more AI and Web3 developers to smoothly transition within a few weeks, ultimately becoming a participant in the DeAI ecosystem.**

## Three Principles
1. Small but beautiful: Not pursuing large and comprehensive, but only focusing on core concepts + runnable code
2. Down-to-earth: Enabling ordinary developers to "understand, use, and spread"
3. Sustainable : Open source collaboration, continuously updated with technological evolution

## We believe 
The future of AI should not be in the hands of a few companies . When developers worldwide can freely access computing power, train models, and deploy applications, and when users truly own their data and AI assistants,  that is what AI should look like . 
This handbook is the starting point, and the real power lies in you -  reading it, using it, improving it, and spreading it . 

# Before starting
- ⏱️ Recommended Reading Time: 2 hours for a full read, 30 minutes for a quick skim
- 💻 Technical Reserve: Basic knowledge of programming (Python) / basic understanding of blockchain is sufficient
- 🎯 How to Use: You can read in order or jump directly to the practical projects that interest you
Let's embark on this decentralized AI journey!
